# 2048 game
This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game, built with JavaScript.

## Gameplay
- Start the game by clicking the Start button.
- Use the arrow keys (←, ↑, →, ↓) to slide tiles across the grid.
- Combine tiles with the same number to form a new tile (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4).
- Win by creating a tile with the number 2048.
- The game ends when there are no possible moves left.

## Technologies
- HTML: For basic game markup.
- SCSS: For simple styles for the game.
- JS: The entire game logic is implemented in JS.
